# CC105 Online Voting System

## Introduction
This project is an Online Voting System created for the CC105 – Information Management and Web Development 1 final requirement.  
It showcases the use of web technologies together with a relational database to simulate a simple voting process.

## System Description
The system allows the management of voters, candidates, and voting records.  
Although simplified, it reflects how data is stored, related, and displayed in a real-world voting application.

## Tools and Technologies
- HTML for page structure
- CSS for layout and visual styling
- JavaScript for form validation and basic interactivity
- MySQL for database management

## Database Structure
The database is composed of three interconnected tables:
1. Voters – stores voter information
2. Candidates – contains candidate details
3. Votes – records voting transactions and links voters to candidates

Primary keys and foreign keys are implemented to ensure proper relationships and data integrity.

## Web Pages Included
- voters.html – manages voter records
- candidates.html – displays candidate information
- votes.html – simulates the voting process
- voting.sql – SQL script for database creation and sample data

## Key Functionalities
- Add and view records using HTML forms
- Client-side validation using JavaScript
- Structured tables for displaying information
- Relational database with sample data

## Learning Outcomes
This project helped strengthen understanding of:
- Database relationships
- SQL table creation and constraints
- Basic frontend validation
- Integrating database concepts with web development
